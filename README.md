# Movie Recommender System

## Overview

The Movie Recommender System is a machine learning-based application designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This system uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide accurate movie suggestions. 

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user preferences and the preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on movie attributes such as genre, director, and actors.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Users can receive movie recommendations tailored to their interests.
- **User Interaction**: Users can rate movies and get real-time recommendations based on their ratings.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms.
- **Surprise**: A Python library for building recommendation systems.
- **Flask/Django** (Optional): For building a web interface for movie recommendations.

## Dataset

This recommender system uses the **MovieLens dataset** which contains information about movies and user ratings. You can download the dataset from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommender-system.git
    cd movie-recommender-system
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

### Recommendation Based on Similar Users (Collaborative Filtering)

```python
from recommender_system import CollaborativeFiltering

# Load the dataset
cf = CollaborativeFiltering('dataset/movielens_data.csv')

# Get recommendations for a specific user
user_id = 1
recommendations = cf.get_recommendations(user_id)

# Print recommendations
print(recommendations)
```
